We got it all to work until we added in the rollback method.
It randomly seg faults and we're not quite sure why because in practice our rollback hsould be fine
All we're doing is pushing a BST object onto a stack. We're also using a call by value so that it doesn't change anything
In theory we should be fine unless there's some c++ nuance that we didn't get.
OVerall I think we underestimated that part of the assignment.
